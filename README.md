## For All Your One Stop Shop Needs!

Hello! This is my e-commerce website that I made using React and commerce.js as my first attempt to using a free api from the web. I will also be using Stripe as my main method of online payment.

### To Start:
  - simply fork or clone this repo, head to the parent directory and inside your terminal run 'npm install' for the dependencies.
